    "This workbook implements a single-level Analytic Hierarcy Process (AHP) for a problem input by a user. By single-level, I mean that the problem involves a single goal, a single set of criteria (no sub-criteria), and a single set of alternatives. This notebook is intended to be an extension of the AHP tutorial given in the \"Supplier Selection Methods - AHP Introduction\" notebook. Since this is an extension, calculation details are excluded and the notebook. For details on the procedure, please see the aforementioned notebook, which follows a tutorial format.\n",
