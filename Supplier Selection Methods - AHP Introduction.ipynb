    "In contrast to the weighted sum, weighted product, and TOPSIS methods introduced in other notebooks, the method presented in this notebook focuses on a technique that is applicable when a set of candidate suppliers has been identified, and we are trying to come up with a ranking for the candidate suppliers. In particular, the technique we will be studying is known as the Analytic Heirarchy Process (AHP).\n",
    "\n",

    "# Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) - Leader Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This workbook implements the Analytic Hierarcy Process (AHP) for the leader selection example posted at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_hierarchy_process_%E2%80%93_leader_example (accessed 1/16/2018). Details of the example, from the website, follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ## Overview\n",
    ">This example describes the use of the AHP in choosing a leader for a company whose founder is about to retire. There are several competing candidates and several competing criteria for choosing the most suitable one. By using the AHP, the board of directors is able to choose the best candidate in a rational, transparent way that can be examined and understood by all concerned.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The diagram below shows the AHP hierarchy at the end of the decision making process. The goal is to choose the most suitable leader based on four specific criteria. Dick is the preferred alternative, with a priority of .493. He is preferred about a third more strongly than Tom, whose priority is .358, and about three times more strongly than Harry, whose priority is only .149. Experience is the most important criterion with respect to reaching the goal, followed by Charisma, Education, and Age. These factors are weighted .547, .270, .127, and .056, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The balance of this article describes the derivation of these priorities.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Decision Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    ">The company, founded in 1960, makes specialized industrial equipment. Its future success will depend on maintaining the strength of its older product lines and on generating a constant flow of new ones. The company's founder is retiring soon, and a consulting firm has developed a detailed plan for continuing its success in his absence. The plan will take five years to implement, and will replace the founder's highly subjective \"seat of the pants\" style with a more carefully thought out way of doing business.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The board of directors needs to choose someone to lead the company through the change and upheaval that implementing the consultant's plan will involve. In doing this work, the new leader will be required to make many unpopular decisions and take many unpopular actions. He or she will be expected to “clear the air” by stepping aside after the plan is fully implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Six months ago, the board said:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>After much thought and discussion, we have identified four criteria to be used in choosing the person to guide us through the upcoming period of change: **experience**, **education**, **charisma** and **age**. Experience is important because the job requires skills and knowledge that can only be developed through practical application. And though our beloved founder was a self-made man who didn’t finish high school, the times demand that our new leader have an appropriate university education. Since the new leader will have to keep us all motivated during a difficult period of change, we prefer someone with an active, charismatic leadership style. Finally, the new leader's Age is important because he or she will need to have an appropriate career path after stepping down five years from now. — Board of directors, letter to employees and shareholders\n",
    "\n",
    ">Last week, they said:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>After an extensive search, we have selected three candidates for this very challenging position. All are presently executives with the company. Choosing among them will be difficult, but we plan to announce our decision shortly. — Board of directors, followup letter to employees and shareholders\n",
    "\n",
    ">The three candidates are Tom, Dick, and Harry. Summaries of their backgrounds are shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "> <img src=\"images/AHP_Leader_Biographies.png\" style=\"width:550px;height:470px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Decision Hierarchy\n",
    "The AHP hierarchy for this decision is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "> <img src=\"images/AHP_Leader_Hierarchy.png\" style=\"width:450px;height:300px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    ">As the decision makers continue with the AHP, they will determine priorities for the candidates with respect to each of the decision criteria, and priorities for each of the criteria with respect to their importance in reaching the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The priorities will then be combined throughout the hierarchy to give an overall priority for each candidate. The candidate with the highest priority will be the most suitable Alternative, and the ratios of the candidates' priorities will indicate their relative strengths with respect to the Goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Pairwise Comparisons\n",
    "\n",
    ">The priorities will be derived from a series of measurements: pairwise comparisons involving all the nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Each colored box in the hierarchy diagram above is called a node.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The nodes at each level will be compared, two by two, with respect to their contribution to the nodes above them. The results of these comparisons will be entered into a matrix which is processed mathematically to derive the priorities for all the nodes on the level.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The comparisons can be made in any sequence, but in this example we will begin by comparing the Alternatives with respect to their strengths in meeting each of the Criteria. Then we'll compare the Criteria with respect to their importance to reaching the Goal.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Since there are three alternatives (Tom, Dick, and Harry) and we need to compare each one to each of the others, the decision makers (the Board) will make three pairwise comparisons with respect to each Criterion: Tom vs. Dick, Tom vs. Harry, and Dick vs. Harry. For each comparison, the Board will first judge which member of the pair is weaker with respect to the Criterion under consideration. Then they will assign a relative weight to the other candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    ">They will use the AHP fundamental scale in assigning the weights:\n",
    "\n",
    "> <img src=\"images/AHP_Scale.png\" style=\"width:500px;height:400px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "> ## Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "> Using their knowledge of the work the leaders will be required to do, the board needs to evaluate the candidates' strengths with respect to experience. Though they have good information about each candidate's work history, there is no such thing as an objective scale for measuring \"experience.\" Thanks to the AHP, the Board will be able to develop a scale, applying only to this one case, that measures the candidates' relative strengths with respect to experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Here is the Board's thinking about experience:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The leader will implement a wide-ranging plan that involves major changes to a successful business. This work requires skills, knowledge, wisdom, and judgment that are usually present only in seasoned executives. Furthermore, the company is so complex and specialized that only direct experience inside it can equip a prospective leader for his job. Outside experience is also important, since it provides perspective and a view of the larger picture. — Board of Directors, Internal Memorandum\n",
    "\n",
    "> As a reminder, here is their summary of the candidates' experience:\n",
    "\n",
    "> <img src=\"images/AHP_Leader_Experience_Summary.png\" style=\"width:700px;height:100px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "> The next step in the AHP is to compare pairs of candidates with respect to Experience. For each comparison, the Board decides which candidate is the weaker with respect to Experience, giving his experience a weight of 1. Then, using the AHP Fundamental Scale, they assign a weight to the experience of the other candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Their comparisons are summarized below. (A summary in this form is not an essential part of the AHP. It is presented here only to help readers understand this example. The colors in the squares will help them see where each entry belongs in the AHP matrix):\n",
    "\n",
    "> <img src=\"images/AHP_Leader_Experience_Grid.png\" style=\"width:800px;height:200px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "> The next step is to transfer the weights to a matrix, using a method unique to the AHP. For each pairwise comparison, the number representing the greater weight is transferred to the box of the corresponding color; the reciprocal of that number is put into the box of the color corresponding to the smaller number:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> <img src=\"images/AHP_Leader_Experience_Matrix.png\" style=\"width:300px;height:250px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "> By processing this matrix mathematically, the AHP derives priorities for the candidates with respect to Experience. The priorities are measurements of their relative strengths, derived from the judgments of the decision makers as entered into the matrix. Mathematically speaking, they are the values in the matrix's principal right eigenvector. These values can be calculated in many ways, including by hand, or with a spreadsheet program, or by using specialized AHP software. They are shown below to the right of the matrix, along with an Inconsistency Factor computed by the specialized AHP software that was used to process the data:\n",
